# SVM
What is SVM?

Support Vector Machines are perhaps one of the most popular and talked about machine learning
algorithms. SVMs are among the best “off-the-shelf” supervised learning algorithms
To tell the SVM story, we’ll need to first talk about margins and the idea of separating data with a large
“gap.”

The different types of Margin classifiers are:
1)Maximal-Margin Classifier
2)Soft Margin Classifier

The different kernels are:
1)Linear Kernel SVM
2)Polynomial Kernel SVM
3)Radial Kernel SVM

Advantages of SVM:
1)The major strengths of SVM are the training is relatively easy. 
2)No local optimal, unlike in neural networks. 
3)It scales relatively well to high dimensional data and the trade-off between classifier complexity and error can be controlled explicitly. 
Disadvantages of SVM:
The weakness includes the need for a good kernel function
